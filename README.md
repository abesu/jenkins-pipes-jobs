Repo containing the job definitions for the [Jenkins Pipes](https://github.com/tknerr/jenkins-pipes-infra) demo:

 * it uses [Job-DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki) to describe **WHAT** (i.e. which repos) to build
 * the **HOW** to build is defined in each of the [referenced repo's](https://github.com/tknerr/jenkins-pipes-helloworld) `Jenkinsfile`s
